Included are 4 .java classes, the submission form and a makefile. I could not edit the checkboxes of the pdf submission form. All of the answers are 'yes': both parts of the project are implemented, they run smoothly and there is one main class initialising things and talking to the user.
the code was tested on an ubuntu terminal


To test the code, please run the following commands on the terminal:

compiling:
$ make

testing:
single runs for each part:
$ make part1
$ make part2

interactive play with multiple runs and choices for game type / agents:
$ make play

remove all the .class files:
$ make clean
