# Connect Four

Code written by Rahaf Al Qarni and [tado-mi](https://www.github.com/tado-mi).

Following is a generic implementation of the Connect Four game using the minimax algorithm, an Artificial Intelligence technique. It is insired from a solution of the assignment for the course [CSC 242](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/ferguson/csc/242/Spring2019/syllabus.html) at the University of Rochester. It is made public to demonstrate a code sample by the authors, and for learning. We trust it will not be used to violate academic honesty policies.

In the included packeage, there are 4 `.java` classes, and a `makefile`, for playing the game Connect Four, as the name suggests.

- [ ] improve makefile

to compile hit
